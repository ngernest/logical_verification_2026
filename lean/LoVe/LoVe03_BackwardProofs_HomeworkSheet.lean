/- ## Question 1: Connectives and Quantifiers

1.1. Complete the following proofs using basic tactics such as `intro`,
`apply`, and `exact`.

Hint: Some strategies for carrying out such proofs are described at the end of
Section 3.3 in the Hitchhiker's Guide. -/

theorem B (a b c : Prop) :
    (a → b) → (c → a) → c → b := by
  intros Hab Hca Hc
  apply Hab
  apply Hca
  exact Hc


theorem S (a b c : Prop) :
    (a → b → c) → (a → b) → a → c := by
  intros Habc Hab Ha
  apply Habc
  . apply Ha
  . apply Hab
    apply Ha

theorem nonsense1 (a b c d : Prop) :
    ((a → b) → c → d) → c → b → d := by
  intros Habcd Hc Hb
  apply Habcd
  . intros Ha
    exact Hb
  . exact Hc

theorem nonsense2 (a b c : Prop) :
    (a → b) → (a → c) → a → b → c := by
  intros Hab Hac Ha Hb
  apply Hac
  exact Ha

theorem nonsense3 (a b c : Prop) :
    (c → (a → b) → a) → c → b → a := by
  intros Hcaba Hc Hb
  apply Hcaba
  exact Hc

theorem nonsense4 (a b c : Prop) :
    (a → a → b) → (b → c) → a → b → c := by
  intros Haab Hbc Ha Hb
  apply Hbc
  exact Hb

/- 1.2. Prove the following theorem using basic tactics. -/

theorem weak_peirce (a b : Prop) :
    ((((a → b) → a) → a) → b) → b := by
  intros Habaab
  apply Habaab
  intros Haba
  apply Haba
  intros Ha
  apply Habaab
  intros Haba

/- ## Question 2: Logical Connectives

2.1. Prove the following property about double negation using basic tactics.

Hints:

* Keep in mind that `¬ a` is defined as `a → False`. You can start by invoking
  `simp [Not]` if this helps you.

* You will need to apply the elimination rule for `False` at a key point in the
  proof. -/

theorem herman (a : Prop) :
    ¬¬ (¬¬ a → a) := by
  repeat rw [Not]
  intros H
  apply H
  intros HnotnotA
  apply False.elim
  apply HnotnotA
  intros Ha
  apply H
  intros
  apply Ha

/- 2.2. Prove the following property about implication using basic tactics.

Hints:

* Keep in mind that `¬ a` is defined as `a → False`. You can start by invoking
  `simp [Not]` if this helps you.

* You will need to apply the elimination rule for `∨` and `False` at some point
  in the proof. -/

theorem about_Impl (a b : Prop) :
    ¬ a ∨ b → a → b := by
  rw [Not]
  intros HnotAorB
  intros Ha
  apply (Or.elim HnotAorB)
  . intros HnotA
    apply False.elim
    apply HnotA
    apply Ha
  . intros Hb
    apply Hb

/- 2.3. Prove the missing link in our chain of classical axiom implications.

Hints:

* One way to find the definitions of `DoubleNegation` and `ExcludedMiddle`
  quickly is to

  1. hold the Control (on Linux and Windows) or Command (on macOS) key pressed;
  2. move the cursor to the identifier `DoubleNegation` or `ExcludedMiddle`;
  3. click the identifier.

* You can use `rw DoubleNegation` to unfold the definition of
  `DoubleNegation`, and similarly for the other definitions.

* You will need to apply the double negation hypothesis for `a ∨ ¬ a`. You will
  also need the left and right introduction rules for `∨` at some point. -/

#check DoubleNegation
#check ExcludedMiddle

theorem EM_of_DN :
    DoubleNegation → ExcludedMiddle := by
  rw [DoubleNegation, ExcludedMiddle]
  intros DNE a
  apply DNE
  rw [Not]
  rw [Not]
  intros HnotEM
  apply HnotEM
  apply Or.inr
  intros Ha
  apply HnotEM
  apply Or.inl
  apply Ha


/- 2.4. We have proved three of the six possible implications between
`ExcludedMiddle`, `Peirce`, and `DoubleNegation`. State and prove the three
missing implications, exploiting the three theorems we already have. -/
